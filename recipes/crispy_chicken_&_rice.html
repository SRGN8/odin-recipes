      <p>
        This meal is so comforting and family friendly. My kids eat every morsel
        on their plates. This is also a super economical way to feed a family or
        a large crowd. Great served with green beans, broccoli, or a salad.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>x6 (4 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>⅔ cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>x2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1½ cups uncooked long-grain rice</li>
        <li>x3 cups chicken stock, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="steps">
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken
          thighs evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven; cook undisturbed until
          golden crisp and easily released from the bottom, about 5 minutes.
          Flip chicken and cook for 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and set
          aside. Chicken will not be cooked through at this point.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add butter to the drippings and melt. Add onion and cook, stirring
          often, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook for 1
          minute. Add rice; cook, stirring to coat grains in drippings and
          lightly toast, about 1 minute. Stir in 3 cups stock and remaining salt
          and pepper. Bring to a boil. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned
          bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Place the chicken thighs over
          the rice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until all liquid has been absorbed and
          chicken is cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Add remaining stock if
          liquid is absorbed before rice and chicken are cooked through.
          Sprinkle with parsley and squeeze lemon juice over the top.
        </li>
      </ol>
